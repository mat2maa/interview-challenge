# Notes

- Updated React and other dependencies, added eslint and Reactstrap as I'm used to a style.
- Using a simple global hook higher-order component to manage state across components ([taken from here](https://gist.github.com/andregardi/ff77857b04cde207cd67bb09861c4086)).
- Split into sensible components, DRY where appropriate.
- Not had much opportunity to use Jest/Enzyme etc in the past, but I've added some simple tests to match the UX requirements.
